# **Who** is Adam Pann?

That could be a very philosophical question. At at high level I'm a software engineer based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. I grew up in the South Bay and went to school outside of Boston at Brandeis University. Where I studied CS, Business, and African & African American Studies.

# **Why** did I make a website?

## 1. Websites are cool

I've been interested in having a personal website for a long time. I've had friends and coworkers who had personal websites that I thought were so cool. But I never felt that I had something worth putting on the web purely becasue I wanted to share it.

## 2. A good URL needs a good website

I've been paying for the url [adampann.com](https://www.adampann.com) for several years now without using it. When I was an intern at [Wisk Aero](https://wisk.aero/) a team member of mine, Kyle Thornton, wanted the url to his name but couldn't because someone was hosting photos of their kid on it. He had created a yearly calendar event to remind himself to check if the URL was open. Seeing his struggle he convinced me to check if mine was avaible, it was. I bought it on the spot. I've been paying for it ever since.

Now I owned it but didn't use it. How lame. I eventually started having my url be a redirect towards important matters like [vote.org](https://www.vote.org/) in the hope that if someone tries to go to my website while it's not being used at least it might be good for socieity.

# **What** should you (the reader) expect here.

I want this website to a place for me to post about all things I'm interested in. This ranges from programming and neovim to slacklining and photography. 

# **When** am I going to create new posts?

This we will have to wait an see. As topics seem interesting & my notes on them grow eventually they might become posts.

# **Where**

This one should be obvious... here. But incase you need somewhere else to checkout:
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adampann/), mostly with landscape photography but you never know what you'll find :)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamPann) not used as often as Instagram but I do use it to tweet at software engineers that I think are cool.

# **How**

This site is hosted using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) & [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
