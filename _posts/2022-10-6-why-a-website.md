# Why did I make a website?

I've been paying for the url [adampann.com](https://www.adampann.com) for several years now without using it for anything. When I was an intern at [Wisk Aero](https://wisk.aero/) a team member of mine, Kyle Thornton, wanted the url to his name but couldn't because someone was hosting photos of their kid on it. He convinced me to see if mine was avaible, it was so I bought it on the spot. I've been paying for it ever since.

Now I owned it but didn't use it. How lame. I eventually started having my url be a redirect towards important matters like [vote.org](https://www.vote.org/) in the hope that if someone tries to go to my website while it's not being used at least it might be good for socieity.

I want this website to a place for me to post about all things I'm interested in. This ranges from programming and neovim to slacklining and photography. 

# Where else do I post stuff?

The other places I post are:
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adampann/), mostly with landscape photography but you never know what you'll find :)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamPann) not used as often as Instagram but I do use it to tweet at software engineers that I think are cool.
