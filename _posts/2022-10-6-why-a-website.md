# Welcome to the first post of my website

## Why did I make a website?

I've been paying for the url [adampann.com](https://www.adampann.com) for several years now without using it for anything. When I was an intern at Kittyhawk a team member of mine wanted the url to his name but couldn't because someone was hosting photos of their kid on it. He convinced me to see if mine was avaible, it was so I bought it on the spot. I've been paying for it ever since.
